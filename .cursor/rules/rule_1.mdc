This SPA is made with Angular. It's a pure SPA with a Django backend available at localhost:3000 (dev).

The Django endpoints are available in the full swagger file in /docs.

1. Always refer to docs/spec.md, unless specified, for the planning of the whole app.
3. Always update docs/memory.md after every task to track your progress and be able to compare with steps.md
4. Always use pre-built components (primeng) unless specified
5. If PrimeNG doesn't have the CSS needed, fallback to Tailwind CSS
